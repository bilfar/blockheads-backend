# Ticket Validation Blockchain (Back-end)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bilfar/blockheads-backend.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.com/bilfar/blockheads-backend)

This repo represents the blockchain server & database written as a final group project during the Makers Academy bootcamp in August 2018. We have a second repository covering our **React/Javascript** front-end [which can be found here]().

In order to meet our initial MVP, our aim is to write a back-end API in **Python** mimicking how blockchain technology processes and validates transactions. These transactions are stored on our dummy 'blockchain', a basic Postgres database.
Once our MVP has been met, our second goal is to remove the **Python** layer and replace it with a smart-contract driven blockchain running on the **Ethereum** network.

Team Blockhead's full project log [can be read here]().
